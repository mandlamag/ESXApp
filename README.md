## Development workflow

After you have set up the project using above instructions, you can use your favorite IDE or text editor to write code, and run the application from the command line. Turn on React Native hot module reloading in the app developer menu to update your application as you code.

To learn how to structure your application and use the Redux application architecture, read the **[Architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for more details.

##### Start the application in iOS simulator
```
$ react-native run-ios
```

##### Start the application in Android simulator
(If using the stock emulator, the emulator must be running)
```
$ react-native run-android
```

##### Run unit tests
```
$ npm test
```

##### Run tests every time code changes
```
$ npm run test:watch
```

##### Generate code coverage report
```
$ npm run coverage
```

Read the **[Testing guide](docs/TESTING.md)** for more information about writing tests.

## Debugging

For standard debugging select *Debug JS Remotely* from the React Native Development context menu (To open the context menu, press *CMD+D* in iOS or *D+D* in Android). This will open a new Chrome tab under [http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui](http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui) and prints all actions to the console.

For advanced debugging under **macOS** we suggest using the standalone [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), which is based on the official debugger of React Native.
It includes the React Inspector and Redux DevTools so you can inspect React views and get a detailed history of the Redux state.

You can install it via [brew](https://brew.sh/) and run it as a standalone app:
```
$ brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger
```
> Note: Make sure you close all active chrome debugger tabs and then restart the debugger from the React Native Development context menu.
